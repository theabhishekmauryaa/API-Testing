### ðŸ“¡ **API Testing Description**

API testing ensures that your application's backend services are working as expected, focusing on validating endpoints, request-response structures, and integrations. Below are the tools and frameworks used for API testing:

#### 1. **Postman**
- A user-friendly tool for manual API testing.  
- Used to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and validate responses.  
- Supports creating collections, running tests, and automating workflows with Newman.

#### 2. **RestAssured**
- A Java-based library for automating REST API testing.  
- Provides support for BDD-style syntax, simplifying request creation and validation.  
- Ideal for validating status codes, headers, payloads, and authentication workflows.  

#### 3. **Cypress**
- Primarily an end-to-end testing tool but supports API testing.  
- Use `cy.request()` to send API calls and validate responses in real-time alongside UI testing.  
- Useful for testing API and UI interactions in a single workflow.

#### 4. **Selenium**
- Not primarily for API testing but can validate API behavior in UI-driven workflows.  
- Combined with libraries like RestAssured or external tools for complete coverage.  
- Suitable for scenarios where API responses affect the UI.

#### 5. **TestNG**
- A testing framework for Java that supports structured testing workflows.  
- Integrates with RestAssured for organized API test execution.  
- Supports parallel execution, data-driven testing, and generating detailed reports.
